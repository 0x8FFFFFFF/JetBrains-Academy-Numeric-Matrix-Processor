# JetBrains-Academy-Numeric-Matrix-Processor

Here’s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding a determinant and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.

Learning outcomes - apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will get familiar with Math library, recursion and the many ways of using nested lists in practice.

This project is a part of the following track - Python Developer

What you’ll do and what you’ll learn:

Stage 1/6: Addition:
With the help of nested lists, learn to add up matrices by element.

Stage 2/6: Multiplication by number:
Learn to multiply a matrix by a number and display the result

Stage 3/6: Matrix by matrix multiplication:
Multiply matrices and create a menu where you can list all the awesome abilities of your processor.

Stage 4/6: Transpose:
Add another useful operation to your processor: allow matrix transposition and add this option to the menu

Stage 5/6: Determined!:
Using recursion, enable your program to find the determinant.

Stage 6/6: Inverse matrix:
Yet another possible operation for is finding an inverse matrix: add this option to your program.
